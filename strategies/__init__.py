# This file makes the 'strategies' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally expose policies directly here for easier import, e.g.:
# from .no_action_policy import policy as no_action_policy
# from .buy_and_hold_policy import policy as buy_and_hold_policy
# from .sma_crossover_policy import policy as sma_crossover_policy

# However, main.py currently uses importlib to load policies by string name,
# so this direct exposure isn't strictly necessary for the current setup.
# Keeping it simple for now.
